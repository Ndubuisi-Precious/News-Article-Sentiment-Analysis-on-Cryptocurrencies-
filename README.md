Cryptocurrency News Article Sentiment Analysis

Approach and Methodology:
1. Data Collection: We gather a comprehensive dataset of news articles from reputable sources, ensuring a diverse representation of the crypto market during the specified period. (I can't lay my hands on source of of data, but was downloaded from kaggle)
2. Preprocessing: To enhance data quality, we preprocess the text by cleaning and tokenizing it. We eliminate irrelevant characters and employ techniques like stopword removal and lemmatization.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, we classify the sentiment of each article as negative, positive, or neutral. This analysis helps us understand the emotional tone of the market.
4. Keyword Extraction: We extract the most common keywords within the dataset. These keywords shed light on dominant text and topics.
5. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Leveraging Spacy's NER capabilities, we identify named entities in the articles. This provides valuable insights into influential individuals, crypto projects, and financial institutions related to the market.
6. Visualization: We present our findings through visually appealing graphs and charts. These visualizations aid in interpreting and understanding sentiment trends, keyword frequencies, and named entities.


However, it is important to note that sentiment analysis is not foolproof and can be influenced by various factors.
If I am pro trader, I will watch out for the months of March, April, May but again pay more attention to November and December. This sentiment analysis is basically done for educational pursposes.
